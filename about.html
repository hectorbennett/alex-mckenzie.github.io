<h2>About</h2> 
    
<p>An Amateur Falconer’s attempt to chart a flown away Falcon’s flight, using data sent back from the revolutionary, albeit somewhat defunct RaptorCam™ device. I can’t get any image, moving or still, back from the device, and the GPS isn’t sending back a continuous signal. Instead I am receiving only fragments of data. The OGG. files I receive from the device contain only audio (no video), but embedded within the file is, low and behold, a GPS coordinate. I realise I might have set the software up to send back data only once the falcon is stationary, so will have to conclude that that is the case here. I’ve asked the good people at Raptorcam™ about the lack of image, but it’s sadly not something they’re able to figure out without examining the transmitter itself, which of course is still attached to the falcon, who shows no sign of soon returning. 
<br/><br/>

I am a longtime friend and supporter of RaptorCam™ and have been granted early access to this exciting telemetry technology. I am borrowing ‘looks’ from the illustrator Garland A. Sackfield, who is working on some concept art for RaptorCam™, which will feed into the eventual interface of the app and give the project a distinctive style.

I am based in Abbey Wood, my family has been since it was suggested as a cemetery to serve East London during the great burial crisis. The GPS, if it continues to splutter back fragments, should have a reach of up to 100 miles.</p>
