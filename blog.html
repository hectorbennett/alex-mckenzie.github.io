<h2>10/2/2019</h2>
<p>Following the MITRE ATT&CK™ Evaluation of endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, I’ve heard a lot of confusion surrounding the various terms MITRE used, particularly the terms “detections,” “telemetry” and the qualifier “tainted,” which MITRE applied to certain types of telemetry they observed in their evaluation. Each of these terms represents a very different type of data, and each plays a critical role in a successful EDR solution.<br/>

Let’s take a look at each term to compare, contrast and understand the following:<br/>

Why telemetry alone is not the same as detection
Why detection and tainted telemetry are required for a truly effective EDR solution
How CrowdStrike delivers best-in-class results in all three categories
At the conclusion, we’ll suggest possible improvements — taking concepts introduced in the ATT&CK evaluation and seeing how we might incorporate them into the ATT&CK framework.  We believe this could help reduce confusion around some of these concepts.

<p>A foundational capability of EDR solutions is to collect a rich set of raw endpoint telemetry that describes the processes and activities that have happened on an endpoint in great detail. MITRE defines telemetry as “minimally processed data that is accessible to an end user and directly indicates that the red team activity occurred after the user performs human analysis…”<br/>

CrowdStrike Falcon continuously collects comprehensive telemetry, even when malicious or suspicious activity is not being detected on the endpoint. This telemetry includes hundreds of different types of activity such as process creation, HTTP connections, service creation, logins and many other event types.<br/>

As MITRE rightly points out, raw telemetry requires human analysis in order to identify (detect) malicious behavior. Telemetry is necessary but not sufficient to make an effective EDR solution.  Detection and correlation with telemetry are crucial to truly making analysts effective.
